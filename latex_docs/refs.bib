abstract = {In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to accurately infer the evolutionary and transmission history of the virus to inform real-time outbreak management, public health policies and mitigation strategies. Current phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches typically use consensus sequences, essentially assuming the presence of a single viral strain per host. Here, we analyze 621 bulk RNA sequencing samples and 7,540 consensus sequences from COVID-19 patients, and identify multiple strains of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in four major clades that are prevalent within and across hosts. In particular, we find evidence for (i) within-host diversity across phylogenetic clades, (ii) putative cases of recombination, multi-strain and/or superinfections as well as (iii) distinct strain profiles across geographical locations and time. Our findings and algorithms will facilitate more detailed evolutionary analyses and contact tracing that specifically account for within-host viral diversity in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as future pandemics.

abstract = {Background. The transmission of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a matter of major concern, because it could compromise the response to antiretroviral therapy. Material and methods. From 1997 through 2003, genotypic drug resistance profiles in 89 patients with recent HIV-1 seroconversion were compared in a case-control study with HIV-1 genotypes obtained from 520 subjects identified at Hospital Carlos III in Madrid, Spain, as "potential transmitters" of drug-resistant virus. This group consisted of HIV-infected patients experiencing virologic failure of antiretroviral therapy. Results. Drug resistance mutations were recognized in 15 (16.8{\%}) of 89 patients with recent HIV-1 seroconversion (the seroconverter group), providing resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in 14.6{\%}, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in 3.4{\%}, and protease inhibitors (PIs) in 3.4{\%}. Among individuals who were potential transmitters of HIV-1 (the potential transmitter group), drug resistance mutations were found in 80{\%}, providing resistance to NRTIs in 73.7{\%}, NNRTIs in 36.4{\%}, and PIs in 38.7{\%}. The estimated ratio of individuals with recent HIV-1 seroconversion to potential transmitters for drug-resistance genotypes was 0.23 for resistance to NRTIs, 0.09 for resistance to NNRTIs, and 0.09 for resistance to PIs. For specific resistance mutations, the ratio of individuals with recent HIV-1 seroconversion to potential transmitters was 0.18 for 41L, 0.20 for 215Y/F (including revertants), 0.06 for 184V, 0.04 for 103N, and 0.14 for 181C when considering drug resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene; the ratio was 0.12 for 46L, 0.06 for 82A/T/S, and 0.08 for 90L, when examining PI resistance mutations. Conclusion. Strains of HIV with some drug resistance genotypes (41L, 215Y/F, and 181C in the RT gene and 46L in the protease gene) may be more efficiently transmitted than strains with other drug resistance mutations (184V and 103N in the RT gene and 82A/S/T and 90M in the protease gene).},

abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {In opinion mining of product reviews, one often wants to produce a summary of opinions based on product features. However, for the same feature, people can express it with different words and phrases. To produce an effective summary, these words and phrases, which are domain synonyms, need to be grouped under the same feature. Topic modeling is a suitable method for the task. However, instead of simply letting topic modeling find groupings freely, we believe it is possible to do better by giving it some pre-existing knowledge in the form of automatically extracted constraints. In this paper, we first extend a popular topic modeling method, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), with the ability to process large scale constraints. Then, two novel methods are proposed to extract two types of constraints automatically. Finally, the resulting constrained-LDA and the extracted constraints are applied to group product features. Experiments show that constrained-LDA outperforms the original LDA and the latest mLSA by a large margin. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A new variant ‘PMF' of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and $\sigma$ is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and $\sigma$ are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element‐by‐element) by $\sigma$ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non‐negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non‐negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non‐negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.

Online LDA is based on online stochastic optimization with a natural gradient step, which we show converges to a local optimum of the VB objective function. It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by fitting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA finds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time.},
